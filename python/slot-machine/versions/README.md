# Versions Folder ðŸ“‚  

This folder serves as an archive for previous versions of the project, preserving the evolution of the codebase over time. Each version reflects a distinct stage in development, capturing the progress and changes made throughout the project lifecycle.

## Purpose of Archived Versions  

1. **Documentation of Progress:**  
   Each version showcases the changes and improvements made at a specific stage of the project.

2. **Bug Analysis & Debugging:**  
   Old versions can be used to trace and understand bugs or regressions in the code.

3. **Learning & Reference:**  
   The archived versions, particularly earlier ones, may be useful for understanding how the project developed and serve as teachable moments for developers reviewing the project.

## Versioning Overview  

- **Alpha Versions (0.0.X):**  
  Early, playable versions of the project. These versions are functional but not up to release standards and may include significant bugs or incomplete features.

- **Beta Versions (0.X.0):**  
  More polished versions with most core functionality complete. While they may still contain bugs, these versions are closer to being feature-complete and ready for wider testing.

- **Full Release Versions (1.0.0+):**  
  Stable, feature-complete versions intended for general use.

## Notes  

- Versions in this folder may contain outdated or buggy code and should not be used as a base for new features.  
- For the latest version of the project, refer to the main repository.  
- Significant comments and documentation in earlier versions reflect the development process and are gradually removed in later versions for cleaner code.
