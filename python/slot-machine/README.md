# Text-Based Slot Machine

This is a Python project for a text-based slot machine game where users can deposit virtual money, place bets, and try their luck on 1, 2, or 3 lines. The project is designed to demonstrate programming skills such as handling user input, implementing game logic, and managing a balance system. It is intended as part of a portfolio showcasing Python development.

## Features

- **Deposit System:** Users can deposit virtual money into their balance to start playing.
- **Betting Mechanism:** Players can choose to bet on 1, 2, or 3 lines.
- **Win Calculation:** Winning combinations multiply the player's bet by the value of the winning line.
- **Balance Updates:** Winnings are added to the player's balance, and they can continue playing or cash out.
- **Replayability:** Players can decide when to stop and cash out their balance.

## How to Play

1. **Deposit Money:** Enter an amount to deposit into your virtual balance.
2. **Place Your Bet:** Choose how many lines to bet on (1, 2, or 3) and the amount to wager.
3. **Spin the Slot Machine:** The program will determine if you've won and update your balance.
4. **Continue or Cash Out:** You can keep playing or choose to cash out your balance at any time.
